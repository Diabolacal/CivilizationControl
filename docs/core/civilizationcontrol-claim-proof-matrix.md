# CivilizationControl — Claim → Proof Matrix

**Retention:** Carry-forward

> Evidence ledger mapping every demo claim to its proof artifact.
> Sources: shortlist-viability-validation-report.md, gate-lifecycle-runbook.md, gatecontrol-feasibility-report.md, tradepost-cross-address-ptb-validation.md, zk-gatepass-feasibility-report.md, civcontrol-independent-audit.md
> Last updated: 2026-03-24 (OwnerCap model, batch presets, posture/turret, player marketplace)

> **Currency note:** The demo narrative uses **Lux** as the primary player-facing display denomination and **EVE** as the secondary on-chain denomination (e.g., "500 Lux toll · 5 EVE"). Conversion: 100 Lux = 1 EVE. Sandbox validation artifacts in this matrix were captured using **SUI** (the native devnet coin). Submission-grade evidence will use the Lux/EVE denomination on the hackathon test server.

## How to Use This Document

Every claim made in the demo must trace to a row in this matrix. During demo recording, overlay the relevant evidence artifact (tx digest, object ID, balance delta) on-screen at the moment the claim is narrated. Rows marked `[TBD-digest]` require capture during hackathon build on the **hackathon test server** (primary build environment from March 11) — sandbox digests below are proof-of-pattern, not submission artifacts.

### Six Non-Negotiable Proof Moments

If the demo shows nothing else, these six overlays must appear on-screen with their tx digest or state proof. They are marked **★ Tier A** in the matrix below.

1. **Policy deploy** — tx digest proving gate policy preset was deployed to multiple gates in one batch PTB.
2. **Hostile denied** — pre-captured tx digest from hostile wallet showing MoveAbort when a wrong-tribe pilot attempts to jump. Shown as post-production overlay (operator dashboard cannot observe cross-wallet failures).
3. **Ally tolled + revenue** — tx digest showing `TollCollectedEvent` (CC custom event) + toll transfer, with operator balance delta.
4. **Defense mode** — single tx digest containing `PostureChangedEvent` + N × turret `ExtensionAuthorizedEvent` (world turret module), proving infrastructure-wide posture switch.
5. **Trade buy + settlement** — tx digest showing atomic buy (payment to seller, item to buyer, listing deactivated).
6. **Player marketplace** — player accesses SSU DApp URL from in-game browser, browses and purchases listing.

### Posture & Turret Doctrine (added 2026-03-24, revised 2026-03-23)

| Demo Claim | Evidence Type | Source | Tx Digest / Object ID | Demo Overlay Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ★ Defense Mode — single click, infrastructure-wide posture switch | Live — single PTB fires set_posture + N × authorize_extension | postureSwitchTx.ts, posture.move, turret.move (unified module) | `[TBD-digest]` (submission UI tx) | PostureChangedEvent + ExtensionAuthorizedEvent entries in Signal Feed |
| Turret doctrine changes from Commercial → Defense atomically | Live — authorize_extension<DefenseAuth> replaces CommercialAuth per turret | world::turret::authorize_extension | `[TBD-digest]` | ExtensionAuthorizedEvent overlay: assembly_id, extension_type |
| Posture switch is reversible (Defense → Commercial) | Live — operator clicks Commercial mode, turrets swap back to CommercialAuth | postureSwitchTx.ts | `[TBD-digest]` | Before/after posture indicator + turret extension state |
| Turret targeting under CC doctrine (Tier 2 — revised) | **Downgraded.** Game engine calls `get_target_priority_list` via devInspect (read-only simulation). Events emitted during devInspect are NOT persisted. CC can only prove doctrine *authorization* (ExtensionAuthorizedEvent), not live engagement. **Module name fix (v3):** Unified `turret.move` module matches game engine's hardcoded `moduleName = "turret"` — extensions are now resolvable. Requires re-authorization after upgrade. | turret.move (unified), world::turret.move | N/A — no on-chain event | Proof-of-command: ExtensionAuthorizedEvent confirms CC doctrine is bound. Behavioral proof: fly neutral outsider to commercial gate → not targeted. |

### Batch Preset Deployment (added 2026-03-24)

| Demo Claim | Evidence Type | Source | Tx Digest / Object ID | Demo Overlay Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| Per-gate OwnerCap borrow/return in batch PTB | Code analysis — each gate's OwnerCap<Gate> borrowed and returned within the same PTB | gatePolicyTx.ts | N/A (pattern proof) | PTB structure diagram: borrow → set_policy_preset → return × N |

### Player-Facing Marketplace (added 2026-03-24)

| Demo Claim | Evidence Type | Source | Tx Digest / Object ID | Demo Overlay Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Player marketplace page accessible via in-game DApp URL | Live — /ssu/:ssuId route renders standalone marketplace | SsuMarketplacePage.tsx | N/A (UI proof) | Screenshot of player-facing marketplace page |
| Player can buy listing from in-game browser | Live — useBuyListing hook signs purchase from player wallet | useBuyListing.ts, tradePostTx.ts | `[TBD-digest]` | ListingPurchasedEvent in Signal Feed |

## Utility Metrics

Three quantified targets for the demo. Values marked `[TBD]` are refined during demo recording with real submission-chain data.

### 1. Operations Reduction

**Target:** 20+ CLI commands → 1 click per gate policy change

| Metric | Baseline (CLI) | CivilizationControl | Evidence Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configure tribe + toll rule on one gate | ~8 CLI commands (build, publish, authorize extension, set tribe rule, set toll rule, verify state × 2) | 1 click ("Deploy Policy") | gate-lifecycle-runbook.md Steps 11a-11d |
| Full gate lifecycle setup | 13+ sequential CLI steps | [TBD] steps in UI | gate-lifecycle-runbook.md (13 steps documented) |
| Cross-address buy transaction | ~4 CLI commands (split-coins, assign, move-call buy, verify) | 1 click ("Buy") | shortlist-viability-validation-report.md Test 5 PTB pattern |

**Demo proof:** Side-by-side comparison — raw CLI vs CivilizationControl UI for the same policy change operation.

### 2. Governance Consequence

**Target:** [TBD] policy enforcements captured in demo (minimum 3: one deny, one toll-pass, one permit-jump)

| Metric | Target | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|
| Hostile denied (tribe mismatch) | ≥1 pre-captured from hostile wallet (post-prod overlay) | Failed tx digest + MoveAbort code `(gate_control, EAccessDenied)` from hostile wallet. Operator Signal Feed does NOT show denial — MoveAbort reverts all events. Evidence is a post-production inset from the hostile’s perspective. |
| Ally tolled (payment + passage) | ≥1 visible in Signal Feed | Tx digest showing `PermitIssuedEvent` + `TollCollectedEvent` (CC custom events) via Transit Proof. `JumpEvent` requires AdminACL co-sign and is not dashboard-triggerable. |
| Revenue visible in real-time | Toll revenue counter updates during demo | Before/after balance delta for collector address |
| Policy change reflected in enforcement | ≥1 policy change → subsequent behavior change shown | Two tx digests: before policy (open) and after policy (filtered) |

**Demo proof:** Uninterrupted consequence sequence — set policy → hostile denied → ally tolled → revenue shown.

### 3. Economic Utility

**Target:** [TBD] SUI toll + trade revenue visible in Signal Feed during demo

| Metric | Target | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|
| Toll revenue captured | ≥[TBD] SUI across demo gate jumps | Collector address balance delta |
| Trade revenue captured | ≥[TBD] SUI across demo TradePost buys | Seller address balance delta |
| Combined revenue visible | Total shown in Command Overview or Signal Feed | Aggregate balance summary |
| Atomic settlement proof | ≥1 complete buy showing payment + item transfer in one tx | Tx digest with `ListingPurchasedEvent` (CC custom) + balance changes |

**Demo proof:** Revenue counter in Signal Feed ticking up as toll + trade events occur.

## Evidence Gaps (To Capture During Hackathon Build)

| Gap | What's Needed | When to Capture | Risk if Missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hackathon test server tx digests | All `[TBD-digest]` rows above | During build on hackathon test server (March 11+) | Cannot overlay tx proof in demo |
| UI-driven policy change tx | Single tx from "Deploy Policy" button | After GateControl UI is functional | Cannot prove operations reduction claim |
| UI-driven buy tx | Single tx from "Buy" button | After TradePost UI is functional | Cannot prove commerce UX claim |
| Real-time Signal Feed screenshot | Screenshot/recording of feed updating in real-time | During demo recording | Cannot prove monitoring claim |
| Revenue totals | Aggregate SUI revenue figures | At end of demo recording session | Cannot state quantified economic utility |
| Sponsored tx evidence (stretch) | Tx showing sponsor ≠ sender | If AdminACL access resolved on test server | Cannot prove gas abstraction claim |
