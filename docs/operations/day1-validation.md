## Check 4 Addendum: Live Object-ID Validation

All 8 provided Utopia IDs verified against live testnet:

| Object | Expected Type | On-chain Type | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| World Package | Package | Package (id confirmed) | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| ObjectRegistry | `object_registry::ObjectRegistry` | `0xd12a...::object_registry::ObjectRegistry` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| KillmailRegistry | `killmail_registry::KillmailRegistry` | `0xd12a...::killmail_registry::KillmailRegistry` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| ServerAddressRegistry | `access::ServerAddressRegistry` | `0xd12a...::access::ServerAddressRegistry` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| LocationRegistry | `location::LocationRegistry` | `0xd12a...::location::LocationRegistry` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| EnergyConfig | `energy::EnergyConfig` | `0xd12a...::energy::EnergyConfig` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| FuelConfig | `fuel::FuelConfig` | `0xd12a...::fuel::FuelConfig` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| GateConfig | `gate::GateConfig` | `0xd12a...::gate::GateConfig` | LIVE-VERIFIED |
| AdminACL | `access::AdminACL` | `0xd12a...::access::AdminACL` | LIVE-VERIFIED |

All objects belong to the same World Package (`0xd12a70c74c1e759445d6f209b01d43d860e97fcf2ef72ccbbd00afd828043f75`).

## Check 5: AdminACL Sponsor-Path — PASS (reclassified)

### Source-level findings

- `verify_sponsor(admin_acl, ctx)` checks either the tx sponsor or sender against `authorized_sponsors: Table<address, bool>`.
- `add_sponsor_to_acl(admin_acl, governor_cap, sponsor)` requires GovernorCap — only the world deployer can enroll.
- **No remove capability** — enrollment is add-only.
- Extension functions (`authorize_extension`, `issue_jump_permit`, DF policy config) do NOT call `verify_sponsor` — witness type / OwnerCap is the auth mechanism. All CivilizationControl-owned operations work without AdminACL enrollment.
- `jump` / `jump_with_permit` / `link_gates` / `share_gate` DO call `verify_sponsor` — these are game-level operations, not builder-extension operations.

### Sponsorship responsibility analysis

| Function | Calls `verify_sponsor`? | Caller responsibility |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `authorize_extension<Auth>` | No (OwnerCap) | CivilizationControl |
| `issue_jump_permit<Auth>` | No (witness) | CivilizationControl |
| Extension DF config writes | No | CivilizationControl |
| `jump` / `jump_with_permit` | Yes | Game / EVE Frontier backend |
| `link_gates` / `share_gate` | Yes | Game / EVE Frontier backend |

### EVE Vault sponsorship relay (source-verified)

EVE Vault provides a **server-managed sponsorship relay** for player-facing sponsored transactions:
1. EVE Frontier backend builds the PTB, pays gas as sponsor (its address is in AdminACL)
2. User counter-signs via zkLogin popup in the Vault extension
3. Server executes the dual-signed transaction on Sui

The dApp never handles gas and never needs AdminACL enrollment. Full analysis: `docs/architecture/evevault-sponsorship-analysis.md`.

### Reclassification

- **Previously:** BLOCKED — framed as requiring GovernorCap access or organizer enrollment.
- **Updated conclusion:** CivilizationControl's own extension/governance functions do NOT require `verify_sponsor`. The AdminACL-gated operations (`jump_with_permit`, etc.) are game-level functions handled by the EVE Frontier backend via the Vault sponsorship relay.
- **Follow-up:** Live confirmation that the end-to-end extended-gate jump flow works on Utopia (EVE Vault + custom extension). This is a validation item, not a blocker.

### Status: PASS — CivilizationControl implementation is not blocked by AdminACL

## Check 6: Builder-Scaffold Reference Paths — PASS

| Path | Exists | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `vendor/builder-scaffold/move-contracts/smart_gate_extension/` | YES | Canonical gate extension reference (sources/, tests/, Move.toml) |
| `vendor/builder-scaffold/ts-scripts/smart_gate_extension/` | YES | Canonical TS scripts (authorise, configure, jump, issue-permit, etc.) |
| `vendor/builder-scaffold/ts-scripts/utils/` | YES | Config, constants, derive-object-id, transaction helpers |
| `vendor/builder-scaffold/move-contracts/smart_gate/` (old) | NO | Removed — correct per 3c65b22 rename |
| `vendor/builder-scaffold/ts-scripts/smart_gate/` (old) | NO | Removed — correct per 3c65b22 rename |

---

## Check 7: Extension Freeze (v0.0.18 feature) — PASS (source-verified)

- `extension_freeze.move` exists in `vendor/world-contracts/contracts/world/sources/assemblies/`
- `is_extension_frozen(object: &UID): bool` — public read function
- `freeze_extension_config(parent: &mut UID, assembly_id: ID)` — package-internal, irreversible
- `remove_frozen_marker_if_present(parent: &mut UID)` — cleanup on unanchor only
- Gate `authorize_extension` guarded by freeze check (L129)
- Demo narrative upgrade: operator freezes gate after configuring policy = proof of immutability

---

## Check 8: SSU Open Inventory (v0.0.18 feature) — PASS (source-verified)

- `deposit_to_open_inventory<Auth: drop>` at storage_unit.move L217
- `withdraw_from_open_inventory<Auth: drop>` at storage_unit.move L241
- Extension-only (require Auth witness matching `storage_unit.extension`)
- Enables escrow, prize pools, courier handoffs

---

## Check 9: Move Package Sanity — PASS

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Package path | `contracts/civilization_control/` — matches repo conventions |
| `Move.toml` name | `civilization_control` |
| Edition | `2024.beta` |
| Address | `civilization_control = "0x0"` (unpublished) |
| World dependency | Commented out (TODO) — expected for Day 1 |
| Sources | Single placeholder module: `placeholder.move` |
| `sui move build` | EXIT 0 — compiles clean |
| `sui move test` | EXIT 0 — 0 tests, 0 failures |
| Tests dir | Does not exist yet — expected |

### Blockers

None. All Day 1 checks pass. CivilizationControl implementation can proceed.

### Follow-up validation (not blocking)

1. **End-to-end extended-gate jump on Utopia** — Confirm that the game/base dApp correctly handles the 2-TX jump flow (`issue_jump_permit` → `jump_with_permit`) for gates with custom extensions, using EVE Vault's sponsored transaction relay. This requires a deployed extension + live Utopia test with EVE Vault.

### Next Steps

1. Uncomment World dependency in `Move.toml` and begin GateControl implementation
2. Build extension, test on localnet, publish to Utopia
3. Run live validation: confirm extended-gate jump works end-to-end with EVE Vault on Utopia
4. If extended-gate jump flow is not handled by the base dApp, evaluate building a jump UI using the `evefrontier:sponsoredTransaction` wallet feature
